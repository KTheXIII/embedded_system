### Assembler and Programmer

[avra](https://github.com/Ro5bert/avra) can be use as assembler. But you'll need to include defintions for different chips. Check [AVR repo](https://github.com/DarkSector/AVR) for defintions. If you have AtmelStudio already you can just use the generated defintions.

[avrdude](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude/) can be use for programming the chip.
