# Memory Types

## Flash Memory

Flash Memory also known as Program Memory, this is where the code is stored. It is non-volatile, meaning the data doesn't go away when there's no power.

## Data Memory

### I/O Registers

This register is used for getting and setting the data to the GPIO(General Purpose) pins.

Check the [registers](/Assembly/Registers.md#io-register) for more detail.

### Internal SRAM

SRAM (Static random-access memory) is a type of random access memory (RAM). SRAM is a volatile memory; data is lost when power is removed.

## EEPROM

EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) is type of non-volatile memory used in computers.
